# .github/workflows/version-check.yml
#
# GitHub Actions workflow for Version Alignment verification.
#
# This workflow ensures that the hardcoded version constant within the source
# code (G_SCRIPT_VERSION) is perfectly synchronized with the latest metadata 
# from the Git repository (tags or short hashes).
#
# This check acts as a release gate to prevent deploying scripts with 
# inconsistent or outdated version information.
